# Performator-Quickstart
This is the Quickstart project of the Performator load testing framework!
This project contains lots of examples and is used as a base project that you can use to start your own projects.
It also contains all the documentation of all the plugins, so that everything is shipped and documented with your project and not somewhere in the depths of the internet.

The documentation of the Performator framework can be found in the folder "/docs" for the version the initiator of the project has cloned.
The most recent version can be found on GitHub: 
https://github.com/Performetriks/Performator-Quickstart/tree/main/docs
